## These are the other repos I have created:
* https://github.com/spark-classes/hw2-git-introduction-ethanrous
* https://github.com/ethanrous/hw2-git-introduction-ethanrous-forked

## What I did:
* I created this repo, added to the README on a branch, and then merged it back to the main branch. 
* I also forked the git intro repo and added to the attendees list, created a PR on GitHub, and merged it back to the main branch on the original repo.
